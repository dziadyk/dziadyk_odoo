            The Silmarillion is a collection of
            mythopoeic stories by the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien, edited
            and published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977
            with assistance from the fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay.The
            Silmarillion tells of Eä, a fictional universe that includes the
            Blessed Realm of Valinor, the once-great region of Beleriand, the
            sunken island of Númenor, and the continent of Middle-earth, where
            Tolkien's most popular works — The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
            — are set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher
            Stanley Unwin requested a sequel, and Tolkien offered a draft of
            the stories that would later become The Silmarillion. Unwin
            rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and "too Celtic",
            so Tolkien began working on a new story that eventually became The
            Lord of the Rings.

            eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages
            between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the
            best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.
